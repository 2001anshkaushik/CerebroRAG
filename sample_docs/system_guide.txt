# Hackathon Submission Guidelines

## Overview
This is a hackathon to build an Agentic RAG Chatbot. 
The goal is to implement File-grounded Q&A, Durable Memory, and Safe Tool execution.

## Rules
1. Any language is allowed.
2. Submission must rely on `make sanity` for verification.
3. Video walkthrough is required.

## Memory Features
The bot should remember user details like "User is a specific role" and company details like "Project X status".
We explicitly do NOT want raw transcripts stored.

## Agentic Capabilities
The bot should use self-correction. If a query fails, it should retry with better keywords.
It should also perform hybrid search using both Vector and BM25 approaches.
