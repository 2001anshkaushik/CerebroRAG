# Project Guidelines

## Overview
This is an implementation of an Agentic RAG Chatbot.
The goal is to implement File-grounded Q&A, Durable Memory, and Safe Tool execution.

## Rules
1. Any language is allowed.
2. Verification relies on Standard Verification (tests/sanity).
3. Documentation is required.

## Memory Features
The bot should remember user details like "User is a specific role" and company details like "Project X status".
We explicitly do NOT want raw transcripts stored.

## Agentic Capabilities
The bot should use self-correction. If a query fails, it should retry with better keywords.
It should also perform hybrid search using both Vector and BM25 approaches.
